what is Terraform
------------------

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.


What is the use of Terraform
----------------------------
Terraform is our tool of choice to manage the entire lifecycle of infrastructure using infrastructure as code. That means declaring infrastructure components in configuration files that are then used by Terraform to provision, adjust and tear down infrastructure in various cloud providers.


How does Terraform work internally
----------------------------------
When terraform init is run, Terraform reads configuration files in the working directory to determine which plugins are necessary, searches for installed plugins in several locations, sometimes downloads additional plugins, decides which plugin versions to use, and writes a lock file to ensure Terraform will use the

Terraform Block
----------------

The terraform {} block contains Terraform settings, including the required providers Terraform will use to provision your infrastructure. For each provider, the source attribute defines an optional hostname, a namespace, and the provider type. Terraform installs providers from the Terraform Registry by default. In this example configuration, the aws provider's source is defined as hashicorp/aws, which is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws.

You can also set a version constraint for each provider defined in the required_providers block. The version attribute is optional, but we recommend using it to constrain the provider version so that Terraform does not install a version of the provider that does not work with your configuration. If you do not specify a provider version, Terraform will automatically download the most recent version during initialization.

To learn more, reference the provider source documentation.


Providers
---------

The provider block configures the specified provider, in this case aws. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to create and manage your resources.

The profile attribute in the aws provider block refers Terraform to the AWS credentials stored in your AWS configuration file, which you created when you configured the AWS CLI. Never hard-code credentials or other secrets in your Terraform configuration files. Like other types of code, you may share and manage your Terraform configuration files using source control, so hard-coding secret values can expose them to attackers.

You can use multiple provider blocks in your Terraform configuration to manage resources from different providers. You can even use different providers together. For example, you could pass the IP address of your AWS EC2 instance to a monitoring resource from DataDog.


Resources
---------

Use resource blocks to define components of your infrastructure. A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as an EC2 instance, or it can be a logical resource such as a Heroku application.

Resource blocks have two strings before the block: the resource type and the resource name. In this example, the resource type is aws_instance and the name is app_server. The prefix of the type maps to the name of the provider. In the example configuration, Terraform manages the aws_instance resource with the aws provider. Together, the resource type and resource name form a unique ID for the resource. For example, the ID for your EC2 instance is aws_instance.app_server.

Resource blocks contain arguments which you use to configure the resource. Arguments can include things like machine sizes, disk image names, or VPC IDs. Our providers reference documents the required and optional arguments for each resource. For your EC2 instance, the example configuration sets the AMI ID to an Ubuntu image, and the instance type to t2.micro, which qualifies for AWS' free tier. It also sets a tag to give the instance a name.


Initialize the directory
------------------------

When you create a new configuration — or check out an existing configuration from version control — you need to initialize the directory with terraform init.

Initializing a configuration directory downloads and installs the providers defined in the configuration, which in this case is the aws provider.

Initialize the directory.


Format and validate the configuration
-------------------------------------

We recommend using consistent formatting in all of your configuration files. The terraform fmt command automatically updates configurations in the current directory for readability and consistency.

Format your configuration. Terraform will print out the names of the files it modified, if any. In this case, your configuration file was already formatted correctly, so Terraform won't return any file names.


Inspect state
-------------

When you applied your configuration, Terraform wrote data into a file called terraform.tfstate. Terraform stores the IDs and properties of the resources it manages in this file, so that it can update or destroy those resources going forward.

The Terraform state file is the only way Terraform can track which resources it manages, and often contains sensitive information, so you must store your state file securely and restrict access to only trusted team members who need to manage your infrastructure. In production, we recommend storing your state remotely with Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise. Terraform also supports several other remote backends you can use to store and manage your state.

Inspect the current state using terraform show.
